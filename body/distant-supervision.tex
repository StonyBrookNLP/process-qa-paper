\subsection{Distant Supervision}
Distant supervision \cite{mintz2009distant},  is an increasingly popular method for relation extraction and typically used in a setting where we have a lot  of unlabeled data and there exist the source of  labeled knowledge base.
They key assumption of distant supervision is " if two entities participate in a relation, any sentence that contain those two entities might express that relation" \cite{mintz2009distant}. 

As in our setting we have very small amount of labeled data and annotation is an expensive effort we try to apply distant supervision to obtain more labeled data. The unlabeled data that we use is the Waterloo corpus. We construct Wumpus query pattern to retrieve the sentences. In particular, we use the following steps:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item Collect most frequent role fillers for each processes.  Create the  query pattern that consist of the role fillers.
\item  For each filtered sentences, we perform matching between token in the sentence and the most frequent role fillers that we have. And then only label the candidate role filler if there is a   up-path $\uparrow$ (dependency path) from the candidate role filler nodes to the trigger node. If there is no such path then skip the sentence.
\item In addition to the previous steps, we also use some simple hand crafted  lexical patterns  to identify \textit{Undergoer, Enabler and Result}.   For example, \textit{Enablers} are often characterized with the preceding words such as \textit{by, through,with, because}. \textit{Results} usually appear after the word \textit{causes, into, produce}.
