\section{Conclusions}
In this work we focused on a semantic role based representation of knowledge about processes expressed in multiple sentences.

Other semi-supervised and un-supervised approaches have been explored for addressing the data sparsity issue in semantic role labeling~\cite{furstenau-emnlp2009,lang-emnlp2011,lang-naacl2010}. We explored a simpler domain adaptation based idea and a distant supervision approach that is much simpler than the ILP based alignment ideas proposed earlier~\cite{furstenau-emnlp2009}. While the domain adaptation idea yields minor improvements, we were unable to benefit from the simpler distant supervision approach.

Overall, we find that the semantic role-based representation we've generated is beneficial for recognizing processes.
Automatic recognition of roles is quite noisy and as a result doesn't yield substantial benefits over simpler bag-of-words representations. 
Our error analysis shows that many questions require substantial reasoning steps beyond simple textual entailment. 
We believe that the semantic role based representations are more suited for building reasoning-based QA systems that can go beyond
mere alignment based approaches.
