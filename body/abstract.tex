We focus on a question answering task involving identification of physical, biological and other natural processes. 
We investigate a simple semantic role based representation for this task. 
Using a set of general roles such as {\em Input}, {\em Result}, and {\em Enabler}, we capture core information about processes. 
We present empirical evaluation of the role-based representations for answering 4th grade level science questions.
Manual identification of these roles provides substantial improvements over simpler bag-of-words (BOW) representation.
We find that automatic role identification is noisy given the limited amount of training data and only provides minor improvements
over BOW.
