We consider a 4th grade level question answering task involving identification of physical, biological and other natural processes. 
Many of these processes involve similar entities and are hard to distinguish using simple bag-of-words representations alone.
Simple semantic roles such as {\em Input}, {\em Result}, and {\em Enabler} often capture the most critical bits of information about processes.
We present empirical evaluation of the role-based representations on a set of 4th grade science questions.
We build a QA system that scores answers by aligning the semantic roles in the question against the roles in the knowledge.
Evaluation shows that manual identification of these roles provides substantial improvements over simpler bag-of-words (BOW) representation.
However, automatic role identification is noisy and only provides limited gains. 
Our analysis shows that many questions require deeper reasoning beyond simple role based alignment and points to interesting avenues for future work.
